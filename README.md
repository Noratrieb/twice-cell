# twice-cell

It's like `once-cell`, except you set the value twice.

## Contributing

I don't actually use this crate, since I figured out in the course of building it that I could just use a different pattern with `OnceCell`. Go figure! I'm still happy to accept pull requests, however, and will respond to issues while they exist in my github inbox.

In particular, I don't really remember most of the implementation details of this crate. I know I tried halfheartedly to add a new nightly feature, but since I gave up on that it wound up just being more noise for the already overworked rust maintainers. Sorry!
